        <header>Homework 3 - Home Page</header>
        <p>
            Prior to this class I gained experience in web development through 
            internships as well as my own startup, <a href="SnoQap.com">SnoQap</a>.
            These experiences have allowed me to work with HTML, CSS, JSP, Django,
            and mySQL. I have not had any experience with JS though, so I am looking
            forward to learning that in this Web Application class. This homework
            required some simple CSS methods to help the general layout of my 
            home page including unordered list formatting for the nav bar, fluid
            layouts for the body using percentages, and some other basic structuring
            methods. This homework assignment allowed me to start learning JavaScript.
            The JS methods used to create a one page website are new to me since
            I previously used Django for this purpose.

        <header> Data Model </header>
        <p>
            My data model consists of three tables: web_users, forum_posts, forum_comments.
            The web_user table consists of my user's data such as name, email, birthday, and membership fee.
            the forum_post contains the information for each post on my forum. It has a title, a body, and a date.
            For my associative table we have forum comments, this has a body, a date, and foreign keys linking to the post and user.

        <p>
            For this assignment, we learned how to access and retrieve data from
            our databases. The overall concept of the connection and querying is easy,
            you open the connection using the url, username, and password then once a
            connection is established you can run a query, return it as a JSON, and then close the connection.
            Once you have the data you can format it using JS, JSP, HTML, and CSS.
            The hard part was using and adapting the sample code. Since we didnt write it,
             it took a while to understand how everything was connected. The most 
             important part is the connectivity of the files, which is going from json 
             to POJO to an HTML Table. During this exercise we also practiced causing 
             DB Errors:
